# Data Warehousing

## Part (1)

Create a system that:

1. Collects data from the internet (either via scraping or using an API).
2. Puts that data into a data store of some sort.
3. Can run on a server.

The data collection should be something that can either be run multiple times or periodically (for example, every day or every week) to fill the data store with the latest of this data from the web, or is something that runs continuously and continuously update the data store.

## Part (2)

Create a Dashboard and run it on a server so it is publically available on the web.
